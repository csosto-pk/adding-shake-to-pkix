Implemenation Name,Implementation Type,Vendor,Version,Approval Status,Notes
OpenSSL,Cryptographical Library,OpenSSL,1.1.1(7.1) ,Approved,Library version 1.0.2 is scheduled to lose support after 2019; hence we'll need for applications to migrate to an OpenSSL version that will receive security fixes
GoLang Crypto,Cryptographical Library,Google,1.12,Approved,"Is not FIPS approved; Google has publicly announced that they have no intention on obtaining FIPS approval; if approval is important, see SpaceMonkey"
SpaceMonkey,Cryptographical Library,Open Source,,Approved,"This is not actually a library; instead, it is a shim layer that connects Go routines to a CiscoSSL/OpenSSL compatible library; this library must be approved"
BouncyCastle,Cryptographical Library,Legion of the Bouncy Castle,,Not Approved,This library includes the Dual-EC random number generator - including that library (even if unused) is not acceptable. This library includes cryptographical algorithms with potental IPR claims (OCB); potential legal risk. This library is also known to have poor side channel resistance; this may be a concern for some uses. Use of CiscoJ as an alternative is recommended.
OpenSSL,Certificate Library,OpenSSL,1.1.1(7.1) ,Approved,Library version 1.0.2 is scheduled to lose support after 2019; hence we'll need for applications to migrate to an OpenSSL version that will receive security fixes
