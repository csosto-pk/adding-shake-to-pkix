    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document describes several cryptographic algorithm identifiers  
	  for variable length SHAKE algorithms introduced in <xref target="SHA3"/> 
	  which can be used with the Internet X.509 Certificate and CRL profile 
	  <xref target="RFC5280"/>. </t>
	  
      <t>The SHA-3 family of one-way hash functions is specified in <xref target="SHA3"/>. 
	  In the SHA-3 family, two extendable-output functions, called SHAKE128 and SHAKE256 are 
	  defined. Four hash functions, SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, and SHA3-512 are also 
	  defined but are out of scope for this document. A SHAKE is a variable length hash function. 
	  The output lengths, in bits, of the SHAKE hash functions are defined by the d parameter. 
	  The corresponding collision and preimage resistance security levels for SHAKE128 and SHAKE256 
	  are respectively min(d/2,128) and min(d,128) and min(d/2,256) and min(d,256) bits. </t>
	  
	  <t>SHAKEs can be used as the hash and mask generating functions in RSASSA-PSS 
	  and ECDSA. In this document we define four new OIDs for SHAKE128 and SHAKE256 
	  used with RSASSA-PSS and ECDSA. The same algorithm identifiers are used for 
	  identifying a public key, and identifying a signature. </t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">  
      <!-- <t>SHAKE128 and SHAKE256 are one-way extensible-output functions. Their output 
	  length depends on a required length of the consumming application. </t> -->
      
      <t>The SHAKEs are deterministic functions. Like any other deterministic functions, 
	  executing each  function with the same input multiple times will produce the 
	  same output. Therefore, users should not expect unrelated outputs (with the 
	  same or different output lengths) from excuting a SHAKE function with the 
	  same input multiple times. </t>
	  
	  <t>Implementations must protect the signer's private key. Compromise of
      the signer's private key permits masquerade.</t>

	  <t>Implementations must randomly generate message-authentication keys
      and one-time values, such as the k value when generating a ECDSA
      signature. In addition, the generation of public/private key pairs
      relies on random numbers. The use of inadequate pseudo-random
      number generators (PRNGs) to generate such cryptographic values can
      result in little or no security. The generation of quality random
      numbers is difficult. <xref target="RFC4086"/> offers important guidance 
	  in this area, and <xref target="SP800-90A"/> series provide acceptable 
      PRNGs.</t>
      
	  <t>Implementers should be aware that cryptographic algorithms may 
	  become weaker with time. As new cryptanalysis techniques are developed 
	  and computing power increases, the work factor or time required to break a 
	  particular cryptographic algorithm may decrease. Therefore, cryptographic
      algorithm implementations should be modular allowing new algorithms
      to be readily inserted. That is, implementers should be prepared to
      regularly update the set of algorithms in their implementations.</t>

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
